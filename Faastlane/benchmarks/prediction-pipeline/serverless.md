This YAML file is a configuration for a Serverless Framework project. It defines the setup for a service named `prediction-pipeline` that will be deployed on AWS. The service consists of three functions (`resize`, `predict`, and `render`), each triggered by HTTP requests. The Serverless Framework is used to deploy and manage applications that use serverless computing on AWS Lambda.

### Breakdown of the YAML File:

- `service: prediction-pipeline`: Defines the name of the service.

- `package: individually: true`: Indicates that the functions will be packaged individually. This means each Lambda function will have its own separate package with only the necessary dependencies.

#### Provider Section

- `provider:`: Specifies the cloud provider and its configurations.
    - `name: aws`: The cloud provider is AWS.
    - `region: us-east-1`: The AWS region where the service will be deployed.
    - `runtime: python3.6`: The runtime environment for the service, here Python 3.6.
    - `stage: dev`: The stage of the service, which is `dev` (development). This can be changed to other stages like `prod` (production) for different deployment environments.

- `iamRoleStatements:`: Defines the IAM role statements, specifying the permissions for the Lambda functions.
    - `Effect: Allow`: Allow the specified actions.
    - `Action: - s3:*`: Grants permissions to perform all actions (`*`) on S3.
    - `Resource: Fn::Join:`: Specifies the resource (S3 bucket) on which actions can be performed. It uses `Fn::Join` to construct the bucket ARN dynamically based on the `BUCKET` environment variable.

- `environment:`: Defines environment variables for the Lambda functions.
    - Variables like `BUCKET`, `FOLDER`, `IMAGE`, `RESIZE_IMAGE`, `MODEL` are declared, which are used within the Lambda functions.

#### Functions Section

Each function defined under `functions:` corresponds to a Lambda function.

- `resize:`: Configuration for the `resize` Lambda function.
    - `handler: resize.resizeHandler`: The handler function (`resizeHandler`) in the `resize` module (file).
    - `package: include:`: Specific files to include in the deployment package.
    - `timeout: 30`: The function execution timeout is 30 seconds.
    - `events:`: Defines the events that trigger this function. Here, an HTTP GET request to the `/resize` path.

- `predict:`: Configuration for the `predict` Lambda function.
    - `handler: predict.predictHandler`: The handler function for the `predict` function.
    - `package: include:`: Includes the `data/` directory in the deployment package.
    - `timeout: 30`: The function execution timeout.
    - `events:`: Triggers on an HTTP POST request to the `/predict` path.

- `render:`: Configuration for the `render` Lambda function.
    - `handler: render.renderHandler`: The handler function for the `render` function.
    - `timeout: 30`: The function execution timeout.
    - `events:`: Triggers on an HTTP POST request to the `/render` path.

#### Plugins and Custom Section

- `plugins:`: Lists plugins used in the Serverless project.
    - `serverless-python-requirements`: A plugin to handle Python dependencies.

- `custom:`: Custom configuration for the plugins.
    - `pythonRequirements:`: Configurations for the `serverless-python-requirements` plugin.
        - `dockerizePip: true`: Uses Docker to build the Python package, ensuring compatibility with the Lambda environment.
        - `zip: true`, `slim: true`: Options to reduce the size of the deployment package.
        - `noDeploy:`: A list of Python packages that should not be included in the deployment package (as they are already available in the AWS Lambda environment).

### Usage Example

This YAML file is used in a serverless project where images are processed through a pipeline involving resizing, prediction (using a machine learning model), and rendering. Each step in the pipeline is handled by a separate Lambda function, triggered by HTTP requests. The Serverless Framework automates the deployment and management of these functions on AWS Lambda.
