This script contains two functions, `timestamp` and `predictHandler`, designed for a serverless computing environment (such as AWS Lambda) where machine learning predictions are made using TensorFlow. The script processes an image, predicts using a pre-trained model, and returns the prediction in its response.

### Function: `timestamp`

This function calculates and adds timing and cost information to a response dictionary.

- `response`: A dictionary to which the function will add timing information.
- `event`: The event data, which may contain previous duration, start time, and cost information.
- `startTime`: The start time of the operation.
- `endTime`: The end time of the operation.
- It calculates the operation's duration and updates the workflow start and end times based on the event data.
- It also calculates the cost related to timestamp operation and adjusts it with the current timestamp operation cost.
- The updated response dictionary is returned.

### Function: `predictHandler`

This function handles prediction events.

1. **S3 Client Initialization**:
    - Initializes an S3 client using Boto3 with AWS credentials. This client is used to retrieve data from an S3 bucket.

2. **Retrieve Resized Image**:
    - The function retrieves a pickled (serialized) image from an S3 bucket (`BUCKET`), located in a specific folder (`FOLDER`) and file (`RESIZE_IMAGE`).

3. **Load Image and Model**:
    - The pickled image is loaded using `pickle.loads`.
    - A TensorFlow graph definition (`GraphDef`) is loaded from a pre-trained model file (`mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_frozen.pb`).

4. **TensorFlow Session for Prediction**:
    - The TensorFlow graph is imported, specifying input and output nodes.
    - A TensorFlow session is created and used to run the model prediction on the image.

5. **Create and Return Response**:
    - The prediction result (`x`) is converted to a list and included in the response body as JSON.
    - The response also includes a status code (200 indicating success).
    - The start and end times are recorded, and the `timestamp` function is called to add timing information to the response.

### Usage Example

1. **Machine Learning Inference in Serverless Architecture**: This script is ideal for a serverless setup where events triggering Lambda functions contain information pointing to image data stored in an S3 bucket. The `predictHandler` function retrieves this image, processes it through a TensorFlow model, and returns the prediction.

2. **Event-Driven ML Predictions**: This could be part of a larger system where events (such as image uploads) trigger machine learning inference tasks without the need for a dedicated server to handle these requests.

### Notes

- The script assumes the existence of certain environment variables (`BUCKET`, `FOLDER`, `MODEL`, `RESIZE_IMAGE`) and the presence of a specific model file.
- AWS credentials are hardcoded, which is not a recommended practice. Ideally, these should be managed using AWS IAM roles and permissions, especially in a production environment.
- The script is designed for TensorFlow 1.x, as indicated by the use of `tf.GraphDef` and `tf.Session`. For TensorFlow 2.x, some modifications would be required.
