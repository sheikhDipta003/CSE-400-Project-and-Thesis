This Python script is designed to be used in an AWS Lambda function for image resizing and storage in AWS S3. Let's go through each part of the script:

### Imports and Initial Setup

- The script tries to import `unzip_requirements`, which is commonly used in AWS Lambda for handling deployment packages with external dependencies.
- `os`, `json`, `time`: Standard Python modules for OS interaction, JSON handling, and time functions.
- `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS services like S3.
- `numpy` and `PIL (Python Imaging Library)`: Used for image processing.
- `pickle`: For serializing Python objects (here, the resized image) into a byte stream.

### Global Variables

- `FILE_DIR`, `BUCKET`, `FOLDER`, `IMAGE`, `RESIZE_IMAGE`: These are configuration variables. `BUCKET`, `FOLDER`, `IMAGE`, and `RESIZE_IMAGE` are set from environment variables, which is a common practice in AWS Lambda for configuration.

### Function `timestamp`

This function updates a response dictionary with timing information.

- Calculates current timestamp (`stampBegin`).
- Updates `response` with the duration of the operation, start and end times, and any prior cost or duration if included in the event.
- Returns the updated response.

### Function `resizeHandler`

This is the main handler function for the AWS Lambda.

1. `startTime = 1000*time.time()`: Records the start time of the function.
2. Opens an image (`"data/image.jpg"`) and resizes it to 224x224 pixels. The image is then normalized (values divided by 128 and subtracted by 1) and reshaped.
3. Initializes a response dictionary with a status code of 200.
4. Serializes the resized image using `pickle`.
5. Records the end time of the function (`endTime`).
6. Initializes a boto3 S3 client with AWS credentials (Note: Hardcoding credentials is not recommended for security reasons. Use IAM roles or environment variables).
7. Puts the serialized image object into an S3 bucket at the specified location (`BUCKET`, `FOLDER`, `RESIZE_IMAGE`).
8. Calls the `timestamp` function to update the response with timing and cost information.

### Usage Example

This script can be used in AWS Lambda for scenarios where you need to resize images and store them in S3. For example, if you have an application that requires images to be a specific size before processing, this Lambda function could be triggered upon image upload to S3, resize the image, and store it back in S3.

### Notes

- Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to read and write to the specified S3 bucket.
- Avoid hardcoding AWS credentials. Instead, use IAM roles assigned to the Lambda function for access to AWS services.
- Be cautious with the image file path (`"data/image.jpg"`); ensure it's correctly set for the Lambda environment. Usually, Lambda functions use the `/tmp` directory for temporary storage.
- The script does not handle exceptions, which is crucial for production code, especially when dealing with file operations and external service calls.
