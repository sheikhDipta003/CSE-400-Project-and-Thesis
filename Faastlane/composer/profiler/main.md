This Python script appears to implement a parallel processing application using Python's `multiprocessing` module. The primary focus of the script is to execute a computation-heavy task (`permWorker` function) in parallel across multiple processes. The script also includes a function (`piWorker`) for calculating an approximation of Pi, but this function is not used in the main execution flow. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Module Imports

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
import time
```

- `multiprocessing`: A module for running multiple processes in Python. It's used to create concurrent execution of a task.
- `time`: Used for measuring the execution time of various parts of the script.

### 2. Global Variable

```python
DEFAULT_ARG = 10
```

- `DEFAULT_ARG`: A default value, presumably used as a default argument for the `permWorker` function when no other value is provided.

### 3. `piWorker` Function

The `piWorker` function is designed to approximate the value of Pi using a series expansion method. Here's a detailed breakdown of its implementation:

```python
def piWorker(n):
    pi_by_4 = 0
    max_denominator = 10**(n+3)
    max_iter = int((max_denominator-1)/2)  # denominator = 2*iter+1
    for i in range(max_iter):
        pi_by_4 += ((-1)**i) * (1/(2*i+1)) * (10**(n+3))
    return int(pi_by_4 * 4/1000)
```

- `n`: The precision parameter for the Pi approximation.
- `max_denominator`: Determines the maximum denominator to be used in the series expansion. It's set to `10^(n+3)`.
- `max_iter`: Calculates the number of iterations needed for the series. This is derived from the formula for the odd denominators of the Pi series (`denominator = 2*iter + 1`).
- The loop calculates the Pi approximation using the Leibniz formula for Pi: `\(\pi = 4 \times \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}\)`. It multiplies the series by `10^(n+3)` for precision and scales it back at the end.
- The function returns an integer approximation of Pi, scaled to `n` decimal places.

### 4. `permWorker` Function

The `permWorker` function appears to be a computation-intensive function that performs operations on permutations. It calculates the maximum number of flips (reversals of elements) required to bring a certain permutation of numbers back to the original order. Here's an in-depth look:

```python
def permWorker(n):
    ...
```

- `n`: The size of the permutation set. The function works with permutations of the set `{1, 2, ..., n}`.
- `count`, `m`, `r`, `check`, `perm1`, `perm`: These variables are used to manage the state and iterations of the permutation generation and manipulation.
- The main logic includes iterating through permutations, counting flips, and finding the maximum flips required for any permutation to be returned to its original order.
- The flipping operation (`perm[:k + 1] = perm[k::-1]`) reverses the order of elements up to the k-th index.
- The function uses a variant of the Heap's algorithm for generating permutations and then applies the flipping process to each.
- The function returns the maximum number of flips found.

### Computational Complexity

Both functions are designed for heavy computational tasks:

- `piWorker`: The computational complexity increases with the precision parameter `n`, as it directly affects the number of iterations in the series expansion.
- `permWorker`: This function has a factorial time complexity due to the permutation generation (`O(n!)`). The task becomes significantly more complex and time-consuming as `n` increases.

These functions are suitable for demonstrating the effectiveness of multiprocessing in handling CPU-intensive tasks in Python.

### 5. `handler` Function

```python
def handler(event, context):
    ...
```

- This function is the main entry point of the script. It receives an `event` dictionary which contains parameters like the number of worker processes (`workers`) and an argument for the `permWorker` function (`perm`).
- It initializes and starts multiple processes to execute `permWorker` in parallel.

### 6. Process Initialization and Execution

```python
    procs = [] 
    for i in range(workers):
        procs.append(Process(target=permWorker, args=[perm]))

    start_create = time.time()*1000
    for idx, proc in enumerate(procs):
        proc.start() 
    end_create = time.time()*1000

    start_join = time.time()*1000
    for idx, proc in enumerate(procs):
        proc.join()
    end_join = time.time()*1000
```

- Creates a list of `Process` objects, each set to execute `permWorker`.
- `proc.start()`: Starts each process in parallel.
- `proc.join()`: Waits for each process to complete.
- Time is recorded before and after creation (`start_create`, `end_create`) and before and after joining (`start_join`, `end_join`) to measure the execution time.

### 7. Response Object

```python
    resp = {}
    resp['start_create'] = start_create
    resp['end_create'] = end_create
    resp['start_join'] = start_join
    resp['end_join'] = end_join

    return resp
```

- Constructs a dictionary (`resp`) with timestamps capturing the process creation and completion times.

### Overall Functionality

- The script is designed to demonstrate multiprocessing in Python.
- It measures the time taken to create, start, and join multiple processes running a CPU-intensive task (`permWorker`).
- The `handler` function can be used in various contexts (like in a serverless environment or a standalone script) to initiate the multiprocessing workload.

### Usage

To use this script, you would need to call the `handler` function with appropriate arguments. For example:

```python
result = handler({'workers': 4, 'perm': 5}, None)
```

This would start the multiprocessing task with 4 workers, each running `permWorker` with an argument of 5. The result would include timestamps of the operation's start and end times.
