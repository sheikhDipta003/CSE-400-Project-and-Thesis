This code defines a class `AWS` which inherits from `faasplatform.Faasplatform`. This class seems to be designed to interact with AWS services, particularly AWS Lambda and IAM, for managing serverless functions. Let's break down each function within the `AWS` class:

### `__init__` Method
The constructor initializes the AWS class instance.
- `self.lamb = boto3.client('lambda')`: Creates a client to interact with AWS Lambda.
- `self.iam = boto3.client('iam')`: Creates a client to interact with AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management).
- Initializes various instance variables like `appDir`, `appName`, `stage`, `functionsToRegister`, and `debug`.

### `__functionName` Method
Generates a formatted function name.
- `megaFnFile` and `function` are concatenated with a hyphen to form a function name.

### `__handlerName` Method
Generates the handler name for the Lambda function.
- Combines `megaFnFile` and `function` with a dot, forming a handler name used in Lambda configurations.

### `__manageRole` Method
Manages IAM roles for Lambda functions.
- `roleName`: Constructs a role name based on the function name.
- Tries to get the role with `self.iam.get_role`. If it doesn't exist (catches `NoSuchEntityException`), it creates a new role.
- The role is created with a policy that allows the Lambda service to assume it (`sts:AssumeRole`).
- Attaches the AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole policy to the new role, which grants the Lambda function basic execution permissions.

### `__delete` Method
Deletes a Lambda function.
- `fnName`: Constructs the function name.
- Calls `self.lamb.delete_function` to delete the function from AWS Lambda.

### Usage Examples

To use these methods, you first need to create an instance of the `AWS` class. Here's an example of how you might do that and use some of the methods:

```python
aws_instance = AWS(debug=True)

# Example: Creating and managing a Lambda function
megaFnFile = "my_lambda_file"
function = "my_function"

# Create or get an IAM role for the Lambda function
role = aws_instance.__manageRole(megaFnFile, function)

# Construct the function name and handler name
func_name = aws_instance.__functionName(megaFnFile, function)
handler_name = aws_instance.__handlerName(megaFnFile, function)

# Example usage might involve deploying a Lambda function here
# (Deployment code not provided in the snippet)

# Deleting the Lambda function
aws_instance.__delete(megaFnFile, function)
```

### Important Notes
1. **Private Methods**: The methods prefixed with double underscores (`__`) are intended to be private. This suggests they are not meant to be called directly from outside the class. In a typical use case, these would be used by other public methods within the class.

2. **Error Handling**: The error handling in `__manageRole` is minimal. In a production environment, you'd want more comprehensive error handling.

3. **Security**: When creating IAM roles and policies, ensure that the least privilege principle is followed to avoid security risks.

4. **IAM Role Creation**: The creation of IAM roles in `__manageRole` should be done with caution, as improper configurations can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### `__deploy` Method
The `__deploy` method in the `AWS` class is designed to deploy a Lambda function to AWS. It takes care of packaging the function code into a zip file, updating an existing Lambda function if it exists, or creating a new one if it does not. Let's break down what each line of code in this method does:

### Method Signature
```python
def __deploy(self, appDir, megaFnFile, function, role, size=128):
```
This method takes five parameters:
- `appDir`: The directory where the application code is located.
- `megaFnFile`: The base name of the Lambda function file.
- `function`: The specific function within the file to be deployed.
- `role`: The IAM role that the Lambda function will assume.
- `size`: (Optional) The memory size allocated for the Lambda function, defaulting to 128 MB.

### Creating the Package
```python
fnName = self.__functionName(megaFnFile, function)
package = '{}/{}.zip'.format(appDir, fnName)
os.system('cd {} && zip -r {} *'.format(appDir, package))
```
- `fnName`: Constructs the function name using `__functionName`.
- `package`: Forms the path to the zip file that will contain the function code.
- `os.system(...)`: Executes a command-line instruction to navigate to `appDir`, then zips all contents of the directory into the specified `package` file.

### Deploying the Function
```python
try:
    response = self.lamb.get_function(FunctionName = fnName)
    response = self.lamb.update_function_code(FunctionName = fnName,
                                   ZipFile = open(package, 'rb').read(),
                                   Publish = True)
except self.lamb.exceptions.ResourceNotFoundException:
    # Lambda not found, create one
    response = self.lamb.create_function(FunctionName = fnName,
                                Runtime ='python3.6', MemorySize=size,
                                Role = role['Role']['Arn'], Timeout=900,
                                Handler = '{}.{}'.format(megaFnFile,function),
                                Code = {'ZipFile': open(package, 'rb').read()})
```
- Tries to get the Lambda function with the given `fnName`.
- If the function exists, it updates the function code using `update_function_code`, where it uploads the zipped file and sets `Publish` to `True`.
- If the function does not exist (caught by `ResourceNotFoundException`), it creates a new Lambda function using `create_function`. It specifies the runtime, memory size, role ARN, timeout, handler (constructed using `megaFnFile` and `function`), and the zipped code.

### Cleanup
```python
os.system('cd {} && rm -r {}'.format(appDir, package))
```
- Executes a command-line instruction to remove the created zip file from the `appDir`.

### Returning the Response
```python
return response
```
- Returns the response from the AWS Lambda API, which contains information about the function that was either updated or created.

### Usage Example
This method would be used internally within the AWS class to deploy Lambda functions. You would call it with the directory of your Lambda function's code, the file name, the specific function to deploy, the IAM role, and optionally, the memory size.

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
appDir = "/path/to/lambda/code"
megaFnFile = "my_lambda_file"
function = "my_function"
role = {"Role": {"Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example"}}

response = aws_instance.__deploy(appDir, megaFnFile, function, role)
```

### Important Notes
1. **Python Runtime**: This method hardcodes the runtime as 'python3.6', which might be outdated or not suitable for all use cases.
2. **Security**: Be cautious with the `os.system` calls, as they can be a security risk if not handled properly.
3. **Error Handling**: More comprehensive error handling might be beneficial, especially in a production environment.
4. **IAM Role**: The method expects the role to be passed in a specific format (`role['Role']['Arn']`). Ensure the role is correctly formatted before passing it to this method.

### `__batchProfile` Method
The `__batchProfile` method in the `AWS` class is designed to run a profiling batch for AWS Lambda functions. It deploys a function, invokes it multiple times under varying configurations, and collects performance data. Let's break down this method step by step:

### Method Signature
```python
def __batchProfile(self, size, procs, times, ITER):
```
This method takes four parameters:
- `size`: The memory size allocated for the Lambda function.
- `procs`: A list of different 'worker' configurations to test.
- `times`: A list of different 'time' configurations to test.
- `ITER`: The number of iterations to run for each configuration.

### Initial Setup
```python
appDir = common.PROFILER_APPDIR
megaFnFile = common.PROFILER_FUNC_NAME
function = common.PROFILER_HANDLER

role = self.__manageRole(megaFnFile, function)
func_name = self.__functionName(megaFnFile, function)
self.__deploy(appDir, megaFnFile, function, role, size)
```
- Sets up the directory, function file name, and handler name from a common configuration module.
- Manages the IAM role for the Lambda function.
- Deploys the Lambda function using the `__deploy` method.

### Initializing the Result Dictionary
```python
result = {}
```
- Initializes an empty dictionary to store the results.

### Running the Profiling Batch
```python
for time in times:
    result[time] = {}
    for proc in procs:
        metadata = {'workers': proc, 'perm': time, 'name': func_name}
        info = []
        stats = []
        for i in range(ITER):
            try:
                response = self.invoke(metadata)
                if not response:
                    continue
                payload = json.loads(response['Payload'].read())
                stats.append(json.dumps(payload) + "\n")
                info.append(payload['end_join'] - payload['start_create'])
            except Exception as e:
                pass
```
- Iterates over each combination of `time` and `proc`.
- `metadata`: Prepares metadata for the Lambda invocation.
- Invokes the Lambda function `ITER` times for each configuration.
- Processes the response payload to extract relevant data.
- Collects `info` and `stats` for each invocation.

### Analyzing Results
```python
result[time][proc] = common.getStats(info)
```
- Computes statistical information (like mean, median, etc.) from the collected `info`.

### Debugging and Data Collection
```python
if self.debug:
    name = "batch-" + str(size) + "MB-" + str(proc) + "-" + str(time) + ".out"
    common.putJson(name, stats)
```
- If debugging is enabled, saves the raw data (`stats`) for later analysis.

### Cleanup
```python
self.__delete(megaFnFile, function)
```
- Deletes the Lambda function after the profiling is complete.

### Returning the Result
```python
return result
```
- Returns the collected and processed results.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you would call it with the desired memory size, a list of worker configurations, a list of times, and the number of iterations. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
size = 128
procs = [1, 2, 4]
times = [100, 200]
ITER = 5

profile_result = aws_instance.__batchProfile(size, procs, times, ITER)
```

### Important Notes
1. **Error Handling**: The method contains a `try-except` block but doesn't do anything with the caught exception (`pass`). Better error handling and logging could be beneficial.
2. **Security and Permissions**: The comment warns about changing permissions due to potential issues with `boto3`.
3. **Lambda Function Constraints**: Ensure that the Lambda function and the environment are configured correctly for profiling (e.g., time and memory limits).
4. **Debug Mode**: When the debug mode is on, additional data is saved for analysis. Ensure sufficient storage and manage sensitive data appropriately.
5. **IAM Role Management**: The method assumes successful role creation and management through `__manageRole`.


### `profile` Method
The `profile` method in the `AWS` class is designed to profile AWS Lambda functions and estimate the optimal number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) for a given memory size. It uses performance data from various configurations of Lambda function invocations to make this estimation. Let's break it down:

### Method Signature
```python
def profile(self, inTime, size=128, useCache=False):
```
- `inTime`: Input time (not directly used in this method, but might be relevant for the context or future extensions).
- `size`: The memory size allocated for the Lambda function (default is 128 MB).
- `useCache`: A boolean flag to determine whether to use cached data or perform fresh profiling (default is `False`).

### Setup and Configuration
```python
procCounts = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
times = [7]
ITER = 10
```
- Defines the configurations for profiling: 
  - `procCounts`: A list of different 'worker' configurations to test.
  - `times`: A list with a single time value (`7`), which might be indicative of a specific timeout or duration for the Lambda function.
  - `ITER`: The number of iterations for each configuration.

### Cache Handling
```python
fileName = "profiler-cache/cache.json"
out = {}
if useCache:
    out = common.getJson(fileName)
    key = str(size)
    if key in out:
        return out[key]
```
- Manages a caching mechanism to avoid redundant profiling.
- If `useCache` is `True`, it attempts to load previously saved profiling data. If data for the current `size` is available, it returns that data immediately, skipping the profiling process.

### Perform Profiling
```python
batchData = self.__batchProfile(size, procCounts, times, ITER)
```
- Calls the `__batchProfile` method to perform profiling if cached data is not used or not available.

### Analyzing Profiling Data
```python
medianIdx = 0
factor = 1.4
vcpus = 1
val = batchData[times[0]]
prevLatency = val[procCounts[0]][medianIdx]
for procCount in procCounts:
    curLatency = val[procCount][medianIdx]
    if curLatency < prevLatency * factor:
        vcpus = procCount
    prevLatency = curLatency
```
- Extracts and analyzes the profiling data to estimate the optimal number of vCPUs.
- The heuristic used is based on the latency comparison with a factor (`1.4`). If the current latency is less than the previous latency multiplied by this factor, update the `vcpus` value.
- `medianIdx` is set to `0`, assuming that the median latency is the first element in the latency data.

### Caching the Results
```python
out[size] = vcpus
common.putJson(fileName, out)
```
- Updates the `out` dictionary with the newly computed `vcpus` value for the given `size`.
- Saves the updated `out` dictionary to the cache file.

### Return Value
```python
return vcpus
```
- Returns the estimated number of vCPUs for the given memory `size`.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you would create an instance of the `AWS` class and call the `profile` method with the desired parameters. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
inTime = 100  # Example input time
memorySize = 256  # Example memory size
useCache = True  # Decide whether to use cached data

vcpus_estimation = aws_instance.profile(inTime, memorySize, useCache)
```

### Important Notes
- The method's logic, particularly the heuristic for vCPU estimation, is based on specific assumptions about how latency scales with the number of workers. This should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the workload and the AWS Lambda environment.
- The method does not use `inTime` directly; it's possible that this parameter is intended for future use or is relevant in a broader context of the class.
- Caching is a critical feature for efficiency, especially when profiling can be resource-intensive. However, be cautious about using stale or irrelevant cached data.

### `register` Method
The `register` method in the `AWS` class is designed to register AWS Lambda functions associated with a specific application. This method manages the registration process and ensures that functions are correctly associated with their respective applications. Let's break down the method:

### Method Signature
```python
def register(self, appDir, megaFnFile, function):
```
- `appDir`: The directory where the application (and its Lambda functions) resides.
- `megaFnFile`: A string representing the filename (without extension) that contains the Lambda function code.
- `function`: The specific function name within `megaFnFile`.

### Handling Application Directory
```python
if self.appDir is None:
    self.appDir = appDir
elif self.appDir != appDir:
    raise Exception('Please register functions only belonging to one app')
```
- This code block ensures that all registered functions belong to the same application.
- If `self.appDir` is not already set, it gets initialized to `appDir`.
- If `self.appDir` is already set but differs from the provided `appDir`, an exception is raised. This restriction ensures that the `AWS` class instance manages functions from only one application at a time.

### Registering the Function
```python
self.functionsToRegister.append([appDir, megaFnFile, function])
```
- The function details are appended to the `self.functionsToRegister` list. This list presumably keeps track of all the functions that need to be registered/deployed.

### Setting Application Name and Stage
```python
if self.appName is None or self.stage is None:
    with open('{}/serverless.yml'.format(appDir)) as stream:
        config = yaml.safe_load(stream)
        self.appName = config['service']
        self.stage = config['provider']['stage']
```
- If `self.appName` or `self.stage` is not set, the method reads the `serverless.yml` file from `appDir`.
- It extracts the application name (`appName`) and deployment stage (`stage`) from the configuration file. These values are crucial for identifying and managing the Lambda functions within the AWS environment.

### Response
```python
response = {'FunctionName':'{}-{}-{}'.format(self.appName, self.stage, fnName)}
return response
```
- Constructs a response dictionary with a `FunctionName` key.
- The `FunctionName` is a combination of `appName`, `stage`, and the function name (`fnName`), formatted to create a unique identifier for the Lambda function.
- This response might be used to verify that the function registration process is set up correctly.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you first need an instance of the `AWS` class. Then you can call the `register` method with the appropriate parameters. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
app_directory = '/path/to/app'
mega_function_file = 'handler'
lambda_function = 'myLambdaFunction'

registration_response = aws_instance.register(app_directory, mega_function_file, lambda_function)
```

This would register the specified Lambda function with the AWS class instance, preparing it for deployment or other management tasks.

### Important Notes
- The method relies on a specific directory structure and the presence of a `serverless.yml` file to function correctly.
- The restriction of registering functions from only one application per instance of the `AWS` class is significant. This design choice might be intended to maintain clear separation and management of different applications.

### `deploy` Method
The `deploy` method in the `AWS` class is responsible for deploying AWS Lambda functions that have been registered with the instance of this class. This method updates the configuration file (`serverless.yml`), sets Lambda function properties, and then triggers the deployment process. Let's break down the method step-by-step:

### Method Signature
```python
def deploy(self, memorySize=3008):
```
- `memorySize`: An optional parameter with a default value of 3008 MB. This specifies the memory allocation for each Lambda function being deployed.

### Initial Setup
```python
deployments = []
config = {}
functions = {}
```
- Initializes `deployments` as an empty list, which will later store the response for each deployed function.
- Initializes `config` and `functions` as empty dictionaries, which will be used to manipulate the serverless configuration.

### Update `serverless.yml`
```python
with open('{}/serverless.yml'.format(self.appDir)) as stream:
    config = yaml.safe_load(stream)
    for registration in self.functionsToRegister:
        # ... [code to update configuration] ...
```
- Opens and reads the `serverless.yml` file from `self.appDir` (the application directory).
- The contents of `serverless.yml` are loaded into the `config` dictionary.

### Register Functions in Configuration
```python
for registration in self.functionsToRegister:
    appDir, megaFnFile, function = registration
    fnName = self.__functionName(megaFnFile, function)
    handlerName = self.__handlerName(megaFnFile, function)
    functions.update({fnName: {'handler': handlerName, 'timeout':28,
    'memorySize':memorySize,'events':[{'http':{'path':function, 'method':'get'}}]}})
    response = {'FunctionName':'{}-{}-{}'.format(self.appName, self.stage, fnName)}
    deployments.append(response)
```
- Iterates over `self.functionsToRegister` to update the function configurations.
- For each function, it sets the handler name, timeout (28 seconds), memory size, and the HTTP event trigger (with 'get' method).
- Each function's name is formatted and added to the `deployments` list as a response.

### Write Updated Configuration Back
```python
with open('{}/serverless.yml'.format(appDir), 'w') as stream:
    yaml.dump(config, stream)
```
- The updated `config` (with the registered functions and their configurations) is written back to the `serverless.yml` file.

### Deploy Using Serverless Framework
```python
os.system('cd {} && '\
          'serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements && '\
          'serverless deploy'.format(appDir))
```
- Uses `os.system` to execute command line instructions:
  - Changes directory to `appDir`.
  - Installs the `serverless-python-requirements` plugin, which is necessary for handling Python dependencies in Lambda functions.
  - Executes `serverless deploy` to deploy the functions as specified in `serverless.yml`.

### Return Deployments
```python
return deployments
```
- Returns the `deployments` list, which contains information about each deployed function.

### Usage Example
To use this method, an instance of the `AWS` class must already have functions registered. Then you can call the `deploy` method:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
# ... [functions are registered with aws_instance] ...
deployment_responses = aws_instance.deploy(memorySize=1024)
```

This will deploy all registered functions with a memory size of 1024 MB.

### Important Notes
- The method relies on the Serverless Framework, a popular tool for managing and deploying serverless applications.
- It assumes the presence of a `serverless.yml` file and a specific directory structure.
- The use of `os.system` for deployment is a straightforward approach but might not be ideal for complex deployment scenarios or error handling.

### `invoke` Method
The `invoke` method in the `AWS` class is designed to call (or "invoke") an AWS Lambda function using the boto3 library. This method takes a `metadata` dictionary as an argument, which contains information required to invoke the Lambda function, such as the function's name. Let's go through the method step by step:

### Method Signature
```python
def invoke(self, metadata):
```
- `metadata`: A dictionary containing the necessary information for invoking a Lambda function. Specifically, it expects the name of the function to be invoked under the key `'name'`.

### Method Description
- The method uses the `invoke` function from the boto3 Lambda client. This function is used to invoke a Lambda function in AWS.

### Method Body
```python
response = None
try:
    response = self.lamb.invoke(FunctionName=metadata['name'],
        InvocationType='RequestResponse', Payload=json.dumps(metadata))
except Exception as e:
    print(str(e))
return response
```
- `response` is initialized to `None`. This will hold the response from the Lambda invocation.
- A `try-except` block is used to handle any exceptions that might occur during the Lambda invocation.
- Inside the `try` block:
  - The Lambda function is invoked using `self.lamb.invoke(...)`.
  - `FunctionName`: The name of the Lambda function to invoke, extracted from `metadata['name']`.
  - `InvocationType`: The invocation type. In this case, `'RequestResponse'` indicates a synchronous call, where the method waits for the Lambda function to complete and return a response.
  - `Payload`: The data sent to the Lambda function. Here, it's the `metadata` dictionary converted to a JSON string.
- If an exception occurs during the invocation, it's caught in the `except` block, and the exception message is printed.
- Finally, the `response` from the Lambda invocation is returned. If the invocation was successful, `response` will contain the result; otherwise, it remains `None`.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you need an instance of the `AWS` class and the necessary metadata (including the function name). Here's an example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
metadata = {'name': 'my_lambda_function', 'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
response = aws_instance.invoke(metadata)
```

This code will invoke the Lambda function named `'my_lambda_function'` with the given metadata.

### Important Notes
- This method currently supports only synchronous invocations (`'RequestResponse'`). Asynchronous invocation and other features are noted as TODOs.
- Proper error handling is crucial, especially in a production environment. While this method prints the error, more sophisticated error handling (like logging or retry mechanisms) might be necessary depending on the use case.
- The `metadata` dictionary can be extended to include other data that the Lambda function expects, making this method quite flexible.

### `invokeCode` Method
The `invokeCode` method in the `AWS` class is designed to generate Python code for invoking an AWS Lambda function using boto3, in a concurrent manner using a thread pool. This method is particularly useful when you want to invoke the same Lambda function multiple times with different inputs, concurrently. Let's break down this method:

### Method Signature
```python
def invokeCode(self, metadata, inputObj, requestsObj):
```
- `metadata`: A dictionary containing information about the Lambda function to be invoked, particularly the function's name.
- `inputObj`: A variable name (as a string) representing a list in the generated code. This list should contain different payloads for each Lambda invocation.
- `requestsObj`: A variable name (as a string) that will be used to store the futures returned by the ThreadPoolExecutor, corresponding to each Lambda invocation.

### Method Description
The method generates a list of strings, each string being a line of Python code. When executed, this code will invoke an AWS Lambda function concurrently for each item in `inputObj`.

### Method Body
The method constructs Python code as a list of strings:
1. `client = boto3.client('lambda')`: Initializes a boto3 Lambda client.
2. `with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(inputObj)) as executor:`: Creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent execution, setting the number of worker threads to the length of `inputObj`.
3. Loop initiation: `\tfor x in range(len(inputObj)):` starts a loop over `inputObj`.
4. `\t\t{}.append(`: Begins appending a future (result of `executor.submit`) to `requestsObj`.
5. `\t\t\texecutor.submit(client.invoke,`: Uses `submit` method of the executor to invoke the Lambda function asynchronously.
6. `\t\t\tFunctionName   = '{}',`: Sets the name of the Lambda function from `metadata['FunctionName']`.
7. `\t\t\tInvocationType = "RequestResponse",`: Sets the invocation type to synchronous.
8. `\t\t\tPayload        = json.dumps(inputObj[x]).encode('utf-8')`: Sets the payload for the Lambda function, encoding the corresponding item from `inputObj` as a JSON string.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you would typically call it to generate the code and then execute that code somehow. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
metadata = {'FunctionName': 'my_lambda_function'}
input_list = 'my_inputs'  # Assume this is a list of payloads
requests_list = 'my_requests'  # This will store the futures

code_lines = aws_instance.invokeCode(metadata, input_list, requests_list)
code_to_execute = '\n'.join(code_lines)
exec(code_to_execute)
```

This would execute the generated code, invoking the Lambda function for each item in `my_inputs`, concurrently.

### Important Notes
- The generated code assumes that `boto3` is imported and available in the environment where the code will run.
- This method is generating dynamic code, which should be used cautiously, especially when dealing with untrusted inputs to avoid security risks like code injection.
- The method does not include error handling in the generated code, which might be necessary for robust applications.
- The generated code is suitable for scenarios where you need to process multiple requests in parallel, making it efficient for batch processing tasks.

### `responseCode` Method
The `responseCode` method in the `AWS` class is designed to generate Python code for processing responses from multiple AWS Lambda function invocations. This method is useful in a scenario where you have invoked several Lambda functions concurrently and now need to process their responses. Let’s break down the method:

### Method Signature
```python
def responseCode(self, outputObj, key, requestsObj):
```
- `outputObj`: A variable name (as a string) representing a list in the generated code. This list will be used to store processed outputs from the Lambda function responses.
- `key`: The specific key within the Lambda function's JSON response payload that you want to extract.
- `requestsObj`: A variable name (as a string) that contains the futures representing the Lambda invocations.

### Method Description
The method generates a list of strings, each being a line of Python code. When executed, this code will iterate through the results of Lambda invocations, extract specific data from the JSON responses, and collect this data into a list.

### Method Body
The method constructs Python code as follows:

1. `results = [ fut.result() for fut in {}]`: This line extracts the results from the futures stored in `requestsObj`. Each future’s `result()` method is called, which contains the response from the Lambda function. The responses are collected into a list named `results`.

2. `for result in results:`: Begins a loop to process each response in `results`.

3. `\tlambdaOut = json.loads(result['Payload'].read().decode('utf-8'))['{}']`: For each result, this line reads the payload (which is a streaming body), decodes it from UTF-8, loads it as a JSON object, and extracts the value associated with the specified `key`.

4. `\tfor output in lambdaOut:`: Starts a loop over the extracted data (assuming it is an iterable).

5. `\t\t{}.append(output)`: Appends each item in the extracted data to the list represented by `outputObj`.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you would call it to generate the code, and then execute that code. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
output_list = 'processed_outputs'  # This will store the processed outputs
key_to_extract = 'desired_key'
futures_list = 'my_requests'  # This contains the futures from Lambda invocations

code_lines = aws_instance.responseCode(output_list, key_to_extract, futures_list)
code_to_execute = '\n'.join(code_lines)
exec(code_to_execute)
```

This would execute the generated code, processing each Lambda function's response, extracting data under the specified key, and storing it in `processed_outputs`.

### Important Notes
- The generated code assumes that the response payload from the Lambda function is in JSON format and contains the specified key.
- Like any dynamically generated code, it should be used cautiously, especially when dealing with untrusted inputs to avoid security risks.
- The method does not handle potential exceptions that might occur during the processing of Lambda responses, like JSON parsing errors or key errors.
- This method is particularly useful in batch processing scenarios where you need to process outputs from multiple Lambda function invocations efficiently.

### `importCode` Method
The `importCode` method in the `AWS` class is designed to generate a list of strings, each representing a line of Python code that handles import statements for specific modules. This method appears to be particularly tailored for use in an AWS Lambda function, especially one deployed using the Serverless Framework. Let's break it down:

### Method Signature
```python
def importCode(self):
```
This method doesn't take any parameters and returns a list of strings.

### Method Description
The method generates Python code for importing necessary modules. The generated code is structured to handle a specific scenario common in AWS Lambda functions deployed with the Serverless Framework.

### Method Body
The method constructs Python code as follows:

1. `try: \timport unzip_requirements`: This line attempts to import `unzip_requirements`. The `unzip_requirements` module is specific to the Serverless Framework, used in AWS Lambda deployments to handle dependencies packaged in a zip file. When a Lambda function is deployed using Serverless with dependencies, these dependencies are zipped and need to be unzipped at runtime.

2. `except ImportError: \tpass`: This line catches an `ImportError` which occurs if `unzip_requirements` is not found. This is common when running the code outside of the Lambda environment (e.g., during local testing), where `unzip_requirements` is not necessary or available.

3. `import boto3`: Imports the `boto3` library, which is AWS's SDK for Python. This SDK is used to interact with various AWS services, including Lambda.

4. `from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor`: Imports the `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module. `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used for creating a pool of threads to execute calls asynchronously. This is often used in Lambda functions for parallel processing.

### Usage Example
To use this method, you would call it to get the list of import statements, and then you can include these lines at the beginning of a Python script or Lambda function code. For example:

```python
aws_instance = AWS()
import_lines = aws_instance.importCode()
code_to_execute = '\n'.join(import_lines)
exec(code_to_execute)
```

This would dynamically add the necessary import statements to your Python environment. This approach is particularly useful when writing code that needs to adapt to different environments (e.g., local vs. Lambda execution).

### Important Notes
- Dynamic import and execution of code like this should be done cautiously, especially in a production environment, to avoid security risks.
- The use of `unzip_requirements` is specific to the Serverless Framework and is not a standard Python or AWS feature.
- This method shows an advanced use case scenario, primarily for those who are comfortable with dynamic code generation and execution.

### `inputs` Method
The `inputs` method in the `AWS` class is a very straightforward and simple method. It returns a list containing two strings: `['params', 'context']`. Let's break down its components and purpose:

### Method Signature
```python
def inputs(self):
```
This method has no parameters and returns a list of strings.

### Method Description
The purpose of this method seems to be to provide a standardized way of defining the input parameters expected by a function, particularly in the context of AWS Lambda functions. In AWS Lambda, each function execution receives two primary pieces of data:

1. `params`: This usually represents the input data to the Lambda function. It could be event data from AWS services that trigger the Lambda function, such as S3 events, DynamoDB updates, or direct API calls with specific data.

2. `context`: This is an object provided by AWS Lambda that provides information about the execution environment of the Lambda function. The `context` object contains metadata such as the function execution time remaining, the function name, the AWS request ID, and other details about the Lambda execution environment.

### Method Usage
This method seems to be a utility function within the `AWS` class to standardize the inputs for Lambda functions. By calling this method, you get a list of the standard inputs (`params` and `context`) that you might expect in a Lambda handler function.

### Example in Lambda Handler
In a typical AWS Lambda function in Python, you might see a handler defined like this:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Function logic goes here
    pass
```

Here, `event` and `context` are analogous to `params` and `context` as returned by the `inputs` method of the `AWS` class. This naming convention (`params` and `context`) might be a design choice of the developers of this particular `AWS` class to maintain consistency or clarity across their codebase.

### Conclusion
The `inputs` method is a simple utility that likely serves to maintain consistency in the way Lambda functions are handled or defined within a larger codebase. It doesn't perform any logic but provides a standard reference for the expected inputs to Lambda functions.

This class provides a structured way to interact with AWS Lambda and IAM, encapsulating the complexities of AWS SDK calls and resource management.
